**HBRecorder** is a video recording tool with pause/start feature & beautiful animations between video segments. **HBRecorder** is build over SCRecorder.

In short, here is a short list of the cool things you can do:

 * Record multiple video segments
 * Zoom/Focus easily
 * Remove any record segment that you don't want
 * Display the result into a convenient video player
 * Save the record session for later somewhere using a serializable NSDictionary (works in NSUserDefaults)
 * Add a configurable and animatable video filter using Core Image
 * Add a UIView as overlay, so you can render anything you want on top of your video
 * Merge and export the video using fine tunings that you choose
 * Examples for iOS are provided.
